We have created connect to Shiksha online portal where teachers and students can have their conduct lectures, submit assignments, and mark attendance for the day. We do not have to worry about which application to use for lectures to attend with the help of zoom call, cisco Webex we can attend this online lecture.
The project Was created with the thought that if we suppose to be hit by a nature pandemic and lockdown to be imposed there has to be a better solution for schools to conduct their schooling on daily basis without much hardship.
Make schools online so that lockdown or pandemics does not bother them much.

#UI/UX

Spring Boot for REST APIs
JPA Repositories for DB and spring connection.

#DB
Oracle19c


#improvements we are looking into
#Webinar APIs
Currently, we do not have any webinar application API integration with our application, we will try to integrate those into our application so a teacher can create the meeting on our platform only.

#UserSession and User Validation
Currently, we are using basic spring java functions to validate users plus maintain the user session to make it more secure and reliable we will integrate it with spring security.

#Microservice
Redesign everything with microservice.

Re-vamp the frontend with Angular.
